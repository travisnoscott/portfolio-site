                <strong>Previous Tech Experience</strong> 
                <br>
                I have been using technology since I was a child. As such, my parents usually refer to me as “tech-savvy.” 
                One of my favourite experiences with technology is building my own computer. I purchased different parts such 
                as the graphics processing unit (GPU) and the central processing unit (CPU), and put it all together into a functioning computer.
                I started this project since I wanted a powerful computer that is able to run more programs at once, and building one is cheaper than 
                buying one from a manufacturer. As for coding, I do not have much experience aside from knowing how to use Google Chrome’s inspect element 
                feature to edit parts of a website’s code myself.

                <strong>Why did I take this course?</strong> 
                <br>
                I took this course because I am very interested in learning how to code.
                As said before, I do not have a lot of experience and have never coded 
                anything by myself. Additionally, I recognize that coding and different 
                skills in the technical field will be useful since technology continues to evolve every day.
                I am also hoping that by taking this course, I open up my opportunities for the future.

                <strong>What do I hope to achieve?</strong> 
                <br>
                By the end of this course, I hope to work towards completing my own coding project. 
                This means that if you are currently viewing my website, then I have achieved one of my goals. 
                Furthermore, I hope that participating in this course will broaden my horizons regarding technology in order to help me with my future careers. 
                My main passion is in medicine, so one day I hope I can develop a program or tool that will be able to assist doctors and patients around the world.
