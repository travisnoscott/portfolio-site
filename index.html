                <strong>About Me</strong> 
                <br>
                    Hello, my name is <strong>Travis</strong> and welcome to my website. I am a high school student currently taking the Computer Science 
                course also known as ICS3U. I created this portfolio so you can explore my life and ambitions in the technological field. I hope by the end of this, 
                you will learn a little bit more about me.</p>

                <strong>Interests</strong> 
                <br>
                    My interests are music and technology. My favourite genres of music are Rap and RnB. I enjoy 
                    listening to these genres of music since they incorporate different musical elements that 
                    influence me into feeling different types of emotions, such as excitement or sadness. 
                    One of my favourite artists would definitely be Lil Uzi Vert, also known as Symere Woods. 
                    Other than his music, I like Lil Uzi Vert since he shows that you can do anything you put your mind to. 
                    Starting his life in the “ghettos,” Lil Uzi Vert pulled himself and his family out of these poor conditions 
                    by working hard every single day. The root of my interest in technology stems from being able to play video games 
                    and view different types of media. As a result, technology has helped me stay connected with my friends as we can 
                    do these activities together.</p>

                <strong>Free Time</strong> 
                <br>
                     In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and watching movies and television (TV)
                    shows. I am really grateful for technology because despite COVID-19 restrictions, technologys
                    ensure that my friends and I can stay connected since we are able to chat and play video 
                    games together. One of the games I enjoy playing with my friends is called Valorant, it’s a 
                    first person shooter game which involves a lot of strategy and communication. Normally when 
                    I can go out in person, I like to play basketball as well.
